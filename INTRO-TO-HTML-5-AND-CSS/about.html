    <h1>Granny Smith</h1>
    <p>I believe that Granny Smith apples get their own description because they're my favorite kind of apple. Depending on the individuals prefrence, Granny Smiths could be your favorite kind of apple! Granny smiths aren't that much different from red or yellow apples, visually. What's more different other than the green hue, is the taste.
        Granny Smith apples are usually described to be more on the sour side! Which is why they're the more popular apple between golden and red..it gives a fun taste that isn't so basic.</p>

    Fruits like strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and peaches are seen to be picked more than apples due to their taste. However, apples arent as boring as they seem! Apples contribute to the most amazing desserts such as a 
    classic apple pie, apple turnover, and many many more. Apples also arent just green, yellow, and red, there are much more apples than that! Just to name a few, there are
