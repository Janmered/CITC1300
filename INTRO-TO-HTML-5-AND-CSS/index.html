<h1>APPLES!</h1>
<p>Apples are deemed as a basic fruit but they are such more than that! Apples contribute to the coolest designs relating to crocheting, painting, knitting, and much more creative skills. Moreover, apples make for a fun acitivity with friends like visiting an apple orchard and analyzing the different apple forms! In fact, Apples play huge roles in such significant paintings
    such as Adam and Eve, Snow White, Your Phone, Issac Newtons theory and much more. In recent times apples have faded away from the spotlight and have been replaced by the aesthetics of strawberries, peaches, watermelons, grapes, pineapples and more. In a sense
the name "pineapple" is contradictory considering that pineapples are not related to apples at-all. However, Apples have always stood out on their own for now and forever.</p>

<h3>Trendy Apples?</h3>
<p>Over the years, people have seem to forget the beauty and signifigance of an apple. It's the fact that everyone can love an apple but it's considered basic despite all it has to give. As stated before, apples have a lot of lore and foretelling to the things we know today. An apple just so happened help us determine the laws of physics, not to trust suspicious hags in the woods, and how to keep a docotr away!
    In recent years, apples kind of show us that despite the importance of something, people will like it's counterpart better because of what's trending at the moment. Despite the trends, apples have been around for 8,000 years to 10,000 years, making them one of the oldest fruits behind figs. This concludes the fact that apples have a well-rounded history and major roles.</p>
