                <p id="blahz">To touch up on the shared name of Mariposa, there's a butterfly that shares the same name as well as a few characteristics! I found this quite interesting because I find that each species compliment eachother very well. Mariposa in spanish also translates to butterfly! </p>

                  <p>The Mariposa flowers (also known as Hedychium coronarium,) symbolism is deeply tied secret messages, especially during the spanish colonial times.

                            <p>The aroma of a Mariposa is meant to help with the relaxtion of one's soul and offer tranquility through a troubled mind-which is quite similar to a hibiscus. The scent is much like taking a hike in the woods and letting nature be the one to relieve your stress.</p>

                  <p>Not only do these flowers have a mesmerizing scent, but they also have a mesmeric visual. Having one or more of these in your garden could draw in the apperance of its equivalent butterfly. Showing off one of these in your garden could show that you're finding restfulness, prosperity, or human love. </p>
                        <p id="bttm">Unlike the other flowers covered, Mariposas tap into a more spiritual meaning. They have intertwined meanings with the blossoming experience of motherhood as well as the final stage of life. Despite this, the flwoers are mainly known to be a good essence and for the one owning them to be viewed with purity and peace.</p>
